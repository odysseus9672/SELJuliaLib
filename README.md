# SELJuliaLibs

This Github contains some utility libraries I made for entertainment. Though
they are intended to be useful for the purposes described in their
internal documentation, I make no warranty that they'll be useful for any
particular purpose.

The HyperRotations module is intended to contain a number of functions
useful for producing N by N rotation matrices, and rotating vectors in
N-dimensions.
